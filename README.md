# Train Ticket Confirmation Predictor Project

Train Ticket Confirmation Predictor
This is a C++ console application designed to help users predict train ticket confirmation probabilities and suggest alternative multi-hop travel routes. It processes train, station, and historical data from CSV files to offer insights on ticket status based on journey details, current waiting list numbers, and dynamically calculated "days to journey."

How to Run
Build: Navigate to your build directory in the command prompt and run cmake --build ..
Execute: After a successful build, go to the Debug (or Release) folder inside build and run .\train_predictor.exe.
Interact: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter origin/destination station codes, journey date (YYYY-MM-DD), and current waiting list number.
